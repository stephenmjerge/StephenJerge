### 🧠 Purpose & Direction
This space serves as both a **research hub** and a **systematic archive** for my ongoing psychological self-study.  
Through journaling, dream analysis, and reflective inquiry, I document the relationship between inner experience, biological processes, and symbolic meaning.  
My goal is to bridge **empirical science** with **depth psychology** — studying how the human mind creates and transforms meaning.
