### 🧠 Purpose & Direction
This space serves as both a **research hub** and a **systematic archive** for my ongoing psychological self-study.  
Through journaling, dream analysis, and reflective inquiry, I document the relationship between inner experience, biological processes, and symbolic meaning.  
My goal is to bridge **empirical science** with **depth psychology** — studying how the human mind creates and transforms meaning.

### 🔬 Current Focus
- Integrating **psychology, psychiatry, and theology** into a unified exploration of consciousness and mental health  
- Developing small research and analytical projects to model emotional and cognitive processes  
- Using GitHub to structure, organize, and analyze my personal reflections and research notes  
- Seeking **research opportunities** that align with psychiatry, neuroscience, and analytical psychology — with the intention of paying forward what I learn

### 🌍 Outlook
I’m committed to an **integrative understanding of the human being** — uniting science, psychology, and spirituality to promote healing and awareness.  
This repository reflects both personal exploration and professional preparation: a living record of inquiry, growth, and the pursuit of knowledge meant to be shared in service to others.
