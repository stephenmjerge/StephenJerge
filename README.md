**Pre-Medical Student | Psychology & Psychiatry**

I build small, practical tools that support psychological and psychiatric research.  
My work focuses on data cleaning, anonymization, research workflow automation, and core computational-psychiatry concepts.

## **Core Projects**

Tools I develop to support clinical research and long-term work in psychiatry:

### [**1. Psych Research Data Toolkit**](https://github.com/stephenmjerge/psych-research-data-toolkit)
Reproducible CSV cleaning, anonymization, descriptives, and symptom-trend visualization.

### **2. Article / DOI Fetcher**  
Fetches academic PDFs, extracts metadata, and keeps research libraries organized.

### **3. Reinforcement-Learning Simulation**  
Simple computational models demonstrating reward learning, decision-making, and prediction-error processes.

### **4. PDF & Research Workflow Organizer**  
Utilities for managing papers, references, and lab-style notes efficiently.

## **Purpose**

Develop the technical and research habits expected of a future clinician-scientist:

- data literacy  
- reproducible workflows  
- research organization  
- computational thinking  
- professional, scientific coding practices
