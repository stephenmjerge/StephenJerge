# **Stephen Jerge Ψ**  
**Clinical-Science–Track Researcher | Psychological Research Developer**

I build small, practical tools that support **clinical and mental-health research**.  
My work focuses on data cleaning, anonymization, reproducible workflows, and computational models of behavior.

---

## **Core Projects**

Tools I develop to support clinical research and long-term work in clinical science:

### 1. [**Psych Research Data Toolkit**](https://github.com/stephenmjerge/psych-research-data-toolkit)  
Reproducible CSV cleaning, anonymization, descriptive statistics, and symptom-trend visualization for mental-health datasets.

### 2. [**Article / DOI Fetcher**](https://github.com/stephenmjerge/article-digital-object-identifier-fetcher)  
Fetches academic PDFs, extracts metadata, and maintains an organized research library for literature-review workflows.

### 3. [**Mini Psychological Assessment Lab**](https://github.com/stephenmjerge/mini-psychological-assessment-lab)  
A small, extensible toolkit that scores common self-report measures (PHQ-9, GAD-7, PCL-5, BDI-II), generates severity categories, creates simple visual progress trends, and produces structured score summaries — all using public scoring instructions and intended for research and educational use.

### 4. [**Reinforcement Learning Simulation**](https://github.com/stephenmjerge/reinforcement-learning-simulation)
Simple computational models illustrating reward learning, prediction error, and decision-making processes relevant to clinical psychology.

### 5. [**PDF & Research Workflow Organizer**](https://github.com/stephenmjerge/portable-document-format-research-workflow-organizer)
Utilities for managing papers, references, annotations, and lab-style notes efficiently.

## **Purpose**

Develop the technical and research habits of a future **clinical scientist**:

- data literacy for psychological research  
- reproducible workflows  
- structured research organization  
- computational and quantitative thinking  
- professional, scientific coding practices  
- tools that directly support clinical and translational research
